1. We would use unit testing to test the "message" feature as it is something that a user can do. We want the "message" to be able to write and send a message to another user. The receiving end of the text is in another test

2. We would use unit testing to test the "max message length" because it is a hard coded number that can be tested. We can test to see the result of a message with more than 80 and less than 80 characters.
